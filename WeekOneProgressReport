This week the team met to establish starting goals and metrics for the project. We broke out into groups and individuals to create an equal workload and keep working towards the end goal. We decided on what we need to get done short-term versus eventual, and are working towards the next goal. Commits to the repository will occur as instances of progress are finished.
